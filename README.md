# Problem Solving with Different Programming Paradigms üß©

This project demonstrates how to solve a specific problem using three different programming paradigms: Procedural, Object-Oriented, and Functional. The project is built with TypeScript and uses Deno as the runtime environment.

## Problem Statement üéØ

We get some Cards and Numbers from user as input
For each card, the score is calculated as follows:
- If there are no matching numbers, the score is 0.
- If there is one matching number, the score is 1.
- For each additional matching number, the score is doubled.

## Paradigms Implemented ‚ú®

- **Procedural Programming**: The problem is solved using a step-by-step approach with functions that perform specific tasks.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: The problem is solved by creating objects with properties and methods that encapsulate data and behavior.
- **Functional Programming**: The problem is solved using pure functions and immutable data, focusing on composition and avoiding side effects.

## Features ‚öôÔ∏è

- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and improves code quality.
- **Deno Runtime**: Provides a modern and secure environment for executing JavaScript and TypeScript code.
- **Clear Code Examples**: Each paradigm is implemented in a separate module for easy comparison.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: The code is well-commented and easy to understand.
